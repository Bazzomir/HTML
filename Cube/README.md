Dice Faces with Hover Text (HTML & CSS)
###
This exercise showcases a simple interactive dice component built with HTML and CSS. All six faces of a standard die (1–6) are visually represented using dots (pips).

Features:
Each dice face is displayed as a styled box with the corresponding number of dots.
On hover, the visual dots are hidden and replaced with the text name of the number (e.g., ONE, TWO, THREE, etc.).
Built purely with HTML and CSS—no JavaScript required.

Learning Objectives:
Practice using Flexbox/Grid for layout.
Learn how to apply hover effects using :hover and CSS transitions.
Understand how to conditionally toggle content visibility using CSS only.
This is a beginner-friendly project to improve understanding of layout and interaction using just HTML and CSS.
